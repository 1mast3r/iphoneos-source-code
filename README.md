1. Introduction:
   The iPhoneOS 1.0 source code and the ability to extract source code from iPhoneOS 1.0 to iOS 11.4.1 firmware gives users access to the archived source code, allowing them to explore and analyze its functionality as well as create their own projects based on that code. It is important to note that the free source code version contains closed and proprietary components.

2. Getting the source code:
   - To get the iPhoneOS 1.0 source code, you can refer to the firmwares at ipsw.me, or other resources dedicated to downloading iOS ipsw firmware files.
   -On GitHub you can find the source code for various components of the iOS system open to Apple.

3. Analyzing the source code:
   - After obtaining the source code of iPhoneOS 1.0 or source code from iPhoneOS 1.0 to iOS 11.4.1 systems, developers can use it to analyze the functionality and implementation of various components of the operating system.
   - Using development environments such as Xcode can simplify working with the source code and enable developers to create their own custom firmware based on this code.

It is important to note that source code availability and usage may change over time.
